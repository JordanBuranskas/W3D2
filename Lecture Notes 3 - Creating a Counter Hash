# Hash.new(0): Works fine because we cant mutate integers

# h = Hash.new { |h, k| = h[k] = 0 }

# counter = Hash.new(0)
# => {}
# counter [:amin] += 1 
# => 1                    ... weve changed it to 1 because weve done a reassignment
# counter [:amin]
# => 1 
# counter [:kyle]
# => 0
# counter 
# {:amin => 1}
